# IQ-option-C-custom-api
I'm creating an custom IQ Option Api, to help peoples who want to automated create robots.

For now, it's working:
Get Server Time;
Set Local Time;
Get Profile info;
Get Active list;
Get Balance Info;
Set Balance account type;
Get Candle List;
Get Realtime Candles;
Request Buy;
Get Result;

And come with some indicators:
Sma;
Ema;
RSI;
MACD;
Bollinger Band;
Fractal;
Horizontal Support and Resistance;
